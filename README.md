## Bayes based Auto-Correct
In this notebook a wrongly spelled word is corrected based on the probabability of its one edit and two edit options in a corpus of the text. In this model, the context is not considered and is a very simple, but useful before looking into attention based models that calculate the probability of each word based on the context (other words in the text).
